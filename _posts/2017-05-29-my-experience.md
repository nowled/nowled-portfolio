title: My Experience At Bloc
---
With at the risk of sounding hokey I have to say I  truly enjoyed my learning experience at Bloc; learning at this bootcamp has smashed a lot of my assumptions that I had about web-development; For starters, I, like most civilians, assumed that web-development was all about the latest and greatest cool technologies we can use, to click or push an online button that will miraculous churn out a beautifully developed website in minutes ---heck they did that on one episode of "Mr.Robot" surely I can do the same.


At Bloc I learned that programming is more than tool centered but a state of mind and problem solving, when I heard that the first thing that came to mind was -- What? Problem Solving? --Stop the Clock! I want to be a web developer and have fun doing it, I don't want to have problems. But it was so much more than that, for example you learn  "why, in certain situations, you should not use a fancy "for in" loop when just a plain "for loop" would suffice, why the former would at times just pull down properties you didn't want or need.   It is this type of problem solving and goal centered curriculum that makes you a better problem solver and developer in the end.



Bloc also has a mentor program, which is extremely helpful, especially at times when you get stuck on problems in a project and don't want to write a post to some message board, in hopes that you will receive an answer within a week, if you receive one at all. With the meetings with your mentor you have plenty of opportunities to clear up any misunderstandings or confusion that you may have, which helps you move a step closer to your  days as a professional web developer. All in all my experience at Bloc has been very pleasing.
