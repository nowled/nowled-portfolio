My goal as a web-developer is to develop a product that the users are excited about it and the clients love. I would like to study  the users and observe their habits while using our products, and find out what they like about it and what they feel can be improved. Constantly learning and improving as a developer is an objective that I am always striving for, and to work closely with like minded team players in the tech community.
