## Explanation

Bloc-Jams is a wonderful music player which is sometimes compared to Spotify. This was the first project that I worked on using Vanilla Javascript/CSS/HTML/JQuery and eventually AngularJS. I found that while Vanilla Javascript was easier to read because the functions are practically spelled out for you and they seem easier to read; (document.getElementsByClassName(classNames));   as opposed to JQuery's more compact syntax; .$('className'); ---JQuery offers quick and easy functionality without a lot of markup, due to it's extensive library, this made for an interesting start in creating new components for the bloc-jams apps. But "Angular JS" also took me on another ride of creating and refining Bloc-Jam's user experience.

## Problem

Some minor issues that I did encounter had to do with  ---page load time, it seemed a little slow on start-up and while browsing through the collections, the Html constantly reloaded after moving from one page link to another, which seemed to have slowed things down a wee bit. I thought that it would be nicer to have some way to render webpages directly into the browser, without constantly having them re-rendered.

## Solution

"Angular Js Framework" seems to have answered my calls. It creates a wonderful SPA (Single-Page Application) app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use, there is no extra wait-time when moving from link to link. A great aspect of SPAs, is that they can also cache any local storage effectively and make it available to use offline, which you can browse even during a power outage, or an unpaid phone bill. I noticed the easing of the user interface immediately after implementing the Angular Js Framework.
## Results

 What are the results?! A smooth user experience! Nice!! That makes browsing through the "Bloc-Jams" site, feel more like playing and working with a Web application instead of making the users feel like they are just goofing off and flicking through a webpage.

## Conclusion

This was an exciting and wonderful project that I was fortunate enough to work on, it allowed me to showcase some work also helped solidify my own understanding of why "SPA" applications are in high demand. Stayed tuned as more projects are on the way.
